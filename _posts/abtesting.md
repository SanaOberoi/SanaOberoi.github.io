### The Initiative
As a cross-campus cohort, we navigated the shift from AI theory to practical application. This initiative focused on collective learning and demystifying new technologies through hands-on experimentation.

### Key Workstreams
* **Operationalizing AI:** Developed functional tools to streamline everyday workflows and explore commercial applications.
* **Collective Learning:** Facilitated a collaborative environment for 500+ peers to move from curiosity to capability.
* **Hands-on Building:** Shifted the focus from high-level discussion to tangible, functional builds.
