### The Context
When I joined as the first Corporate Development hire at Elevation Capital, I inherited one of India’s largest VC-founder conferences. The problem? It wasn't built to scale. The entire operation was a highly manual bottleneck relying on disparate Excel sheets, requiring a 10-person team to spend months coordinating meetings between our portfolio founders and global investors. 

### The Build
My mandate wasn't just to "run the event"—it was to build a system that made the event effortless. Acting effectively as a Product Manager, I led cross-functional engineering and design teams to build a proprietary, automated event platform from the ground up.

* **User Experience (UX):** I directed designers to move our users out of static spreadsheets and into customized web portals.
* **Backend Logic:** I architected the matching logic and backend databases to enable automatic "double opt-ins" for ~40 portfolio companies and 200+ global capital pools.
* **Workflow Automation:** I partnered directly with the tech team to replace manual email chains and Zoom link generation with a one-click system.

### The Impact
I condensed a months-long, 10-person manual grind into an automated product that required only ~5 hours per week to manage. We successfully enabled 600+ curated meetings, doubled overall attendance, and expanded our coverage across the Americas, Europe, Middle East, and SEA.
